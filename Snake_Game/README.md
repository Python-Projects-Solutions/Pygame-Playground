# Snake Game <br><br/>

The Snake game is a classic arcade game that has been around for decades. It is a simple game that involves controlling a snake as it moves around the screen, eating food and avoiding obstacles.
As the snake eats more food, it grows longer, making it more difficult to control and avoid crashing into walls or its own tail.

The objective of the game is to eat as much food as possible without crashing into any obstacles.
The game ends when the snake crashes into a wall or its own tail.

The Snake game was created in the mid-1970s by a video game developer named Gremlin Industries. 
The game was originally called Blockade and was inspired by the classic arcade game, Atari's Surround.

Blockade was a two-player game where each player controlled a line that grew longer as it moved around the screen, with the goal of trapping the other player's line.
However, it was the single-player version of Blockade that became popular and evolved into the classic Snake game that we know today.

The earliest known version of the single-player Snake game was created in 1976 by a developer named Taneli Armanto for the Nokia 6110 mobile phone.
Armanto's version of the game was called Snake and was included as a built-in game on Nokia phones for many years, helping to popularize the game worldwide.

Since then, the Snake game has been ported to countless platforms and has been played by millions of people around the world. 
Its simple gameplay and addictive nature have made it a classic and a popular choice for game developers looking to create simple and fun games.
